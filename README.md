As a student who has taken Physical Chemistry 1 and 3, I've always been fascinated by the intricate dance of molecules described by chemical kinetics. However, I often found the process of solving the complex systems of differential equations to be tedious and time-consuming, especially when applying the rigorous methods from my Mathematics for Physicists and Numerics courses.

This project, AutoKinetics, was born from a desire to bridge that gap. It's a computational tool designed to handle the heavy mathematical lifting, allowing us to focus on the chemistry. It translates intuitive, visual representations of reaction mechanisms into a robust quantitative analysis, making it an ideal tool for researchers, educators, and students in chemical engineering and physical chemistry.

## üî¨ Core Features

* **Visual Network Editor:** A drag-and-drop interface to build complex reaction networks using species, groups, and reaction arrows.
* **Object-Oriented Data Model:** Each graphical element holds detailed chemical and physical properties (e.g., enthalpy, Arrhenius parameters, concentration).
* **Integrated ODE Backend:** A powerful backend engine using **SciPy** to solve the system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern the system's temporal evolution.
* **Automated Kinetic Analysis:** The backend automatically analyzes simulation results to:
    * Determine the best-fit reaction order (0, 1st, or 2nd).
    * Calculate the effective rate constant ($k$) via linear regression.
* **Data Persistence:** Save and load entire reaction networks using a human-readable, JSON-based `.kin` file format.
* **Result Visualization:** Automatically generates plots for concentration profiles and rate law analysis.

## üß™ Theoretical Background

The simulation engine is based on fundamental principles of chemical kinetics. The temporal evolution of the concentration of any species $i$, denoted $[X_i]$, is described by a system of ordinary differential equations.

### Differential Rate Laws
The rate of change for the concentration of species $i$ is the sum of the rates of all reactions ($j$) in which it participates:

$$
\frac{d[X_i]}{dt} = \sum_{j} \nu_{ij} v_j
$$

where:
- $\nu_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of species $i$ in reaction $j$ (positive for products, negative for reactants).
- $v_j$ is the rate of reaction $j$.

### Reaction Rate Law
The rate of an elementary reaction, $v_j$, is determined by the concentration of its reactants and a temperature-dependent rate constant, $k_j$. For a generic reaction, the rate is given by:

## üöÄ Getting Started (Dockerized)

You can build and run AutoKinetics in a fully automated, reproducible Docker container. No manual setup is required outside Docker.

### Build and Run with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t autokinetics .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it autokinetics
   ```

### Build and Run with Docker Compose

1. **Start the service:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. **Stop the service:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

### Notes
- The build process (C++ and Python) is fully automated inside the container.
- Source code changes in the host directory are reflected in the container (via volume mount in docker-compose).
- You can modify the `CMD` in the Dockerfile or `command` in `docker-compose.yml` to run other scripts.
* Python 3.9+
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd AutoKinetics
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
    PyQt6
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Launch the GUI:**
    ```bash
    python gui.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Backend Manually (for testing):**
    The backend can be tested directly from the command line by passing a `.kin` file.
    ```bash
    python backend_main.py path/to/your/file.kin
    ```

## üìù `.kin` File Format

The project state is saved in a JSON-based `.kin` file with the following main keys:
* `species`: A list of objects, where each object contains the name, position, and all physical/chemical properties of a species.
* `groups`: A list of visual grouping objects, containing a title and the indices of the species they contain.
* `arrows`: A list of reaction objects, containing kinetic parameters (like `arrhenius_A`, `Ea`) and references to the reactant and product species/groups.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Future development will focus on enhancing the scientific accuracy and user experience:

* [ ] **Temperature is not global** it depends on each individual reaction step
* [ ] **Unit Tests** Increase the stability of the code and make it resistant against bugs in future changes 
* [ ] **Interactive Plotting:** Replace static Matplotlib images with an interactive plotting widget (e.g., using `pyqtgraph`) directly within the GUI.
* [ ] **Global Simulation Conditions:** Create a dedicated panel for global parameters like pressure and temperature, decoupling them from individual reactions.
* [ ] **Reversible Reactions:** Update the ODE solver to correctly handle reversible reactions and equilibrium constants.
* [ ] **NIST Database Integration:** Add functionality to query the NIST Chemical Kinetics Database to automatically populate species and reaction parameters.
* [ ] **Advanced Plotting:** Include plots of analytical solutions for simple-order reactions alongside the numerical results for comparison and verification.
* [ ] **Machine Learning Integration:** Implement ML models to predict rate constants ($k$) from molecular features or to fit complex kinetic models to sparse experimental data.
